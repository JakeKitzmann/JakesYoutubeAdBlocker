I'm too lazy to make a readme. I literally made a program that presses
skip for me. You think I'm going to write this shit?

Kai's bitch ass wants directions

go to chrome://extensions/

turn on developer mode (top right)

press 'load unpacked' (top left)

navigate to the repo and press okay (it should be the whole repo)

you're done!
